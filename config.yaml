    content: |-
      I am a **DevOps & SRE Specialist** bridging the gap between Operations and Engineering through advanced automation and cloud architecture.
      
      Focusing on building resilient and scalable systems, I specialize in:
      * **Infrastructure as Code:** Managing hybrid environments with Docker, Kubernetes, and Terraform.
      * **Observability:** Architecting monitoring solutions with Prometheus & Grafana to ensure 99.9% SLA.
      * **Automation:** Eliminating operational toil using Python, PowerShell, and CI/CD pipelines.

      Currently at **Gameloft**, I focus on DevOps practices within Online Technical Support, ensuring high availability for global game services. Previously, I managed Tier-3 critical infrastructure at **Microsoft** (via Itechwx) for Identity and Azure ecosystems.

      Based in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam
