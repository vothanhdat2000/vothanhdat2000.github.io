      I am a **DevOps & SRE Specialist** bridging the gap between Operations and Engineering through advanced automation and cloud architecture.
      
      With a background at global tech giants like **Microsoft** and **Spotify**, I specialize in:
      * **Infrastructure as Code:** Managing hybrid environments with Docker, Kubernetes, and Terraform.
      * **Observability:** Architecting monitoring solutions with Prometheus & Grafana to ensure 99.9% SLA.
      * **Automation:** Eliminating operational toil using Python, PowerShell, and CI/CD pipelines.

      Currently at **Gameloft**, I architect deployment pipelines and ensure high availability for global game services. Previously, I managed Tier-3 critical infrastructure for **Microsoft** Identity/Azure ecosystems.

      *(This portfolio is built with **Hugo**, deployed via **GitHub Actions**, and engineered for performance.)*
