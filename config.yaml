      I'm a **DevOps Engineer** with over 3 years of experience in system reliability, cloud infrastructure, and automation.
      
      Currently working at **Gameloft**, I specialize in maintaining high-availability services, monitoring with **Prometheus & Grafana**, and supporting development teams with robust DevOps practices.
      
      Previously, I worked as a **Site Reliability Engineer at Microsoft**, where I focused on service stability, incident management, and automation using **PowerShell** and **Azure DevOps**.

      I've got a solid foundation in reliability, a passion for "Moving Up", and the "Architect" mindset that makes this career so exciting.
